# xarm6_control

This module provides real-time control and observation utilities for the xArm6 robot, enabling integration with OpenPI Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. It allows the xArm6 to run inference-based actions from pre-trained models using real sensor inputs and live camera feeds.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Retrieve joint states and camera observations from the xArm6 robot
- Format observations for OpenPI policies (e.g. pi0, xarm6_policy)
- Send actions to the xArm6 controller via `position`, `velocity`, or `servo` mode
- Support for real-world deployment and debug-friendly logging

## Data Transformation

### How to transform data from RLDS into Lerobot
To transform the data, run:
```bash
uv run examples/libero/convert_libero_data_to_lerobot.py --data_dir /home/n10813934/data/tfds_datasets
```

This will convert the data stored in RLDS into pi0's lerobot format. The resuling dataset will be stored in:
`
/home/n10813934/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/dpad25/agrivla_pick_tomatoes_v1
`

### How to confirm data transform
A custom script has been developed (`inspect_lerobot_dataset.py`). To run this script, you will need to pass in the repo_id and the root directory for the dataset you have just created. For this example, I ran:
```bash
uv run examples/libero/inspect_lerobot_dataset.py \
  --repo_id dpad25/agrivla_pick_tomatoes_v1 \
  --root /home/n10813934/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/dpad25/agrivla_pick_tomatoes_v1
```

## Training
When you want to train, make sure to first update the traininig config located in `config.py` to include you updated name and dataset path. 

Then run:
```bash
uv run scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name pi0base_lora_xarm6_round2_fulldataset
```

Replacing `pi0base_lora_xarm6_round2_fulldataset` with the name of your config
## ðŸš€ Running a Policy on xArm6

### 1. Run the Policy Server on the HPC

#### 1.1 ssh into the HPC

```bash
ssh n10813934@aqua.qut.edu.au
```

#### 1.2 Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 1.3 Export the cache location to access checkpoints etc.

```bash
export OPENPI_DATA_HOME=$HOME/.cache/openpi 
```
 
#### 1.4 Run the policy. Note that the configuration (checkpoints, norm stats etc.) are governed by the --env key

```bash
uv run scripts/serve_policy.py --env XARM --port 8000
```

### 2. Set up SSH tunnel from client to the HPC server node

```bash
ssh -L 8000:10.13.22.1:8000 n10813934@aqua.qut.edu.au
```

### 3. Run the client (make relative path)

#### 3.1 Set up enviroment

> - This step activates the local Python environment and configures ROS Noetic support.  
> - It ensures that ROS-related Python modules (e.g., `rospy`) are accessible, and that the workspace is correctly set up for ROS-integrated inference and control.
> - Need to test if we are still actually using the ros python stuff

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages
```

#### 3.2 Run the gripper server

> - **Note:** I need to test the `gripper_server_async`.  
> - When testing this, make sure to also change which class is referenced in `xarm_env.py`.

```bash
uv run src/xarm6_control/gripper_server
```

#### 3.3 (a) Run the client script (refferencing local dir and rospy)

> - **NOTE**: This used to be `PYTHONPATH=.:/opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages uv run src/xarm6_control/main2.py --remote_host localhost --remote_port 8000`, however, I changed it to the below. This needs to be tested. 

```bash
uv run src/xarm6_control/main2.py --remote_host localhost --remote_port 8000
```
